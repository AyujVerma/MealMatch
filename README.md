# MealMatch
An app to cut down on food waste by connecting university dining halls to food pantries and composting sites.

After coming to UT Austin, we noticed that the dining halls had a lot of leftover food after each meal time. Even when the dining halls reused food in successive meals, there would still be food left over that would just be thrown away.

We created Meal Match as a way for dining halls to donate their food to food pantries and composting areas in order to reduce food waste.

We won the Best Sustainablity App at UT Austin's Hack the Future hackathon in March 2023.
